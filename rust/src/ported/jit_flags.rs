//! ---- flags ----
//! Flags are deferred: an instruction records {kind, size, dst, src} and the
//! flags are materialized only if something reads them. On top of that sit
//! three fusions - NZCV forwarded from an adjacent producer across
//! NZCV-transparent gap instructions, value-based conditions taken straight
//! from a result register (cmp #0, or no compare at all for cbz/cbnz), and the
//! comis fusion, where a jcc/setcc/cmov re-derives its condition by redoing the
//! fcmp. Liveness reaches past the block: an exit's flags are dead if the
//! successor, decoded up to three blocks deep, overwrites them before reading
//! them. That lookahead was a fifth of translation time, because every block
//! branching to an untranslated successor decoded it again, so answers are
//! memoized by rip and depth, and an entry counts only while no translation
//! has been retired since and the successor's first sixteen bytes are
//! unchanged.
//! A static liveness pass and the emitters share the same predicates so they
//! cannot disagree about what is live. The legality rules here are written in
//! blood: a gap may not write a register the producer read (a byte compare
//! through an index register the next instruction overwrites made the
//! NZCV-forwarding fallback re-load with the new index, and a loop spun
//! forever), and a gap's emission must touch only pinned registers (`cmp byte
//! [rdi+0x210],0 ; lea r15,[rsp+0x290] ; jne` branched on rsp and made Steam's
//! CEF browser copy an unengaged optional, 2026-09-06), so a gap is emitted
//! into a scratch buffer first and refused there rather than asserting after
//! the compare is already out.
//!
//! No ABI passes arithmetic flags across a return, but clang's outliner does:
//! a helper that ends in a compare and a ret hands its flags to a caller that
//! branches right after the call. Treating every ret as killing the flags
//! painted every Wine window black (2026-09-05). A pure flag producer
//! reaching a ret keeps its flags live; a tail whose last flag writer is
//! arithmetic (xor eax,eax; ret) returns a value, and keeps the dead seam.
//!
//! ---- control flow ----
//! A block may run past a FORWARD conditional branch, continuing inline and
//! putting the taken side in an out-of-line chain stub (a superblock). When
//! the compiler laid the rare path out inline the hot path is the taken edge
//! instead, and the loop fragments into a chain of blocks; such a branch is
//! probed - both sides count in the arena - and a clearly hotter taken side
//! retires the block, which retranslates with the jcc rewritten as its
//! complement. The first window of a loop is often unlike its steady state,
//! so a verdict counts only when the next window repeats it, and the fourth
//! window decides regardless. OCERZ_FLIP_JCC names branches to invert by hand.
//!
//! Edges are chained block to block, and a conditional branch may be
//! retargeted straight at its successor - but only when nothing the successor
//! needs sits between the branch and the chain tail. A stub that replays
//! lane-0 flushes, an FP-batch check or the producer's flag record must stay
//! on the path: a scalar SSE result left in lane-0 scratch and a side exit
//! chained past the flush produced a singular view transform in Cocoa, and a
//! stale flag record handed to a successor (`cmp ebp,0xb ; jbe L` with
//! `L: ja`) failed every SQLite open in libcef.
//!
//! A guest CALL pushes its return address and also pushes {retaddr, host
//! continuation} onto a host-stack shadow and a return-address stack, then
//! `bl`s into the callee body, so the hardware return predictor matches the
//! RAS and a guest RET is a plain ret. 32-bit calls and rets do the same,
//! their shadow entries tagged JIT_KEY_M32 (m32_ras_ok). Indirect jmp/call go
//! through a per-site direct-mapped cache of 32 {rip, body} pairs (16-aligned,
//! so the lookup's ldp is single-copy atomic) before falling into an inlined
//! hash probe and finally C. In 32-bit code a ret, an indirect call and an
//! indirect jmp take the same cache, their target keyed with JIT_KEY_M32 as a
//! 32-bit block's is, where they all left for the dispatcher before; under
//! WoW64 a vtable-call loop went from 1321 to 464 ms and qsort from 634 to
//! 163 ms. Small straight-line callees ending in a plain ret are spliced into
//! the caller: the call becomes a push, the ret a compare against the known
//! return address, and a mismatch leaves at the ret's rip for the dispatcher
//! to run the real one. Where a frame is pure register work the push's slot
//! is provably never read, so the push becomes a bare rsp -= 8 and matched
//! push/pop pairs become register renames - the loop-carried store-to-load
//! chain of call-dense code. The renames borrow x16, x17 and x30 when no
//! memory base is hoisted into them, and every C call-out clobbers all three,
//! so a renamed pop whose push was followed by a call-out reads the slot the
//! push still wrote instead. That happens whenever an instruction between
//! them falls back to C, and in the low shadow window it happened to every
//! spliced call nested inside another, because the inline call and ret need
//! identity addressing there and go through the slow path: a leaf-call loop
//! built at 0x200000000 summed garbage that changed with every run.
//!
//! In that window the stack may live below 12 GB, where guest and host
//! addresses differ, so every stack fast path used to be off there, and every
//! spliced call and ret went out to C: xbench's leafcall took 2.75 s against
//! 0.16 s outside the window. None of the return-address stack depends on the
//! memory mode, only the two guest-stack accesses do, so with the stack
//! pointer pinned as a pointer and a zero guest base (low_stack_fast), a call
//! stores its return address and a ret loads it through the same translation
//! any other low-window access takes, and the rest - the host shadow push, bl
//! into the callee's body, the compare and the plain ret - is what it is
//! everywhere else. A spliced call's pushes and rets do the same, and its
//! elided pushes and matched rets never touched memory to begin with. leafcall
//! went to 0.35 s and icall from 0.74 to 0.44 (0.39 outside the window).
//! OCERZ_NO_LOW_RAS and OCERZ_NO_LOW_SPLICE turn the two halves off.
//!
//! A setcc or cmovcc reads the forwarded NZCV, never the producer's
//! registers, so a sibling consumer in the gap may write one of them
//! (cmp [rcx],eax ; setg al ; setl dl). A jcc can re-derive its condition
//! from them, so it keeps the rule.
//!
//! after ands, as after test, C and V are clear: be/a are e/ne, l/ge/le/g
//! read N and Z alone
//!
//! A loop's first phase can differ from the rest (an array initialised one
//! way, then settled), and every window can fall in it. So a kept branch
//! goes on counting its taken side, tripping at 2^WATCH_BIT, when
//! flip_side_hit probes it again from scratch, FLIP_REARMS times at most.
//!
//! A cmp/test whose first operand is memory, as emit_rmw_mem emits it inline
//! with NZCV set.
//!
//! A load of a stack slot into a pinned register, which the Wine layout emits
//! as a plain load off rsp + x0 (lowstack_disp_ea): flag-free and touching
//! only JTA, so it may sit between a compare and its fused jcc. It can fault,
//! so emit_cmp_test_jcc writes the compare's flags out before it.
//!
//! Rust cannot soundly model sigsetjmp's returns-twice ABI. The eight guarded
//! decode regions therefore call back through `jit_flags_shim.c`, which keeps
//! each jump buffer and setjmp frame in C while the decode callback itself
//! remains Rust.
