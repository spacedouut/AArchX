//! ---- blocks and the cache ----
//! Blocks are keyed by jit_key(rip, mode32): the same guest address in 32- and
//! 64-bit mode is not the same code and must never share a cache entry, a
//! commpage mark or an invalidation mark.  A published block keeps 16 bytes per
//! instruction (rip, len, op) instead of the 96-byte X86Insn; only the few
//! instructions it still executes through the interpreter (slow calls) or
//! inspects in full (fault-flag producers) are copied into blk->kept.  Dropping
//! the decoded array matters: a GUI Wine process carried ~870 bytes of X86Insn
//! per block across 215k blocks, 180 MB of it.
//!
//! ---- invalidation ----
//! Every guest mmap/mprotect/munmap asks the JIT to drop code in a range.  A
//! global min/max cannot answer that under Wine, where the live set spans PE
//! images at 32-bit addresses and shared-cache dylibs at 0x7ff8_0000_0000, so a
//! region map (one slot per 4 MB, a bitmap of the 64 KB granules in it) answers
//! in constant time; it may say "maybe" after code is gone but never "no" while
//! it is present.  When it says "maybe", the blocks to look at come from a list
//! per 64 KB granule kept beside the granule counts, not from a walk over every
//! live block: Unity's Mono JIT writes code all through R.E.P.O.'s startup with
//! about 390,000 blocks live, and that walk plus rebuilding the live array on
//! every retirement were 30% of the game process; a retired block now leaves
//! the live array by swapping with the last one (OCERZ_INV_SCAN=1 walks every
//! block again).  Only the overlapping blocks are retired - dropping the whole
//! cache per flip made CEF startup a full retranslation storm.  Their code stays
//! allocated on a retired list, so a thread still inside runs to its next exit.
//! The words a retirement puts back (stop sites, their conditional sites, the
//! chains of its predecessors) are collected and synchronised together once
//! write protection is back on, one barrier per retirement rather than one per
//! word, before the JIT lock is released.
//! A 64 KB region whose translations keep being invalidated (a JS engine
//! W^X-flipping its code space) is run interpreted after a few hits, but not
//! permanently: module-load fixups also retire blocks a few times and then
//! never again, and a permanent blacklist left the hottest DLL code interpreting
//! forever, so a region quiet for CHURN_QUIET_NS is re-probed.
//!
//! Retired code is never reused in place, so code that keeps being regenerated
//! fills the arena: R.E.P.O.'s Mono JIT retranslates its way through the whole
//! 1 GB within two minutes, after which every new block used to run interpreted.
//! The game also crashed in Mono's metadata code in every run that filled the
//! arena while still loading, and a 512 KB arena reproduces the same kind of
//! damage in tests/dynamic/dlopen_cryptex.c whenever a translation overflows and
//! is followed by more translating; why an overflowing translation leaves the
//! translator in that state is not understood yet, so the arena is no longer
//! allowed to overflow.  When less than an eighth of it, at most 8 MB, is left,
//! the next translation miss flushes it instead: every block is retired, every
//! table that points into the arena (chains, return-address cells and slots,
//! site caches, veneer pools, the dispatch stubs, the code index) is emptied,
//! and translation starts again at the front.  The old code is neither unchained
//! nor pushed through the instruction cache, since nothing runs it again;
//! doing both over a full arena held every thread for a third of a second.  The
//! same flush runs when the return-address slots run out, which retranslation
//! also does, because only a flush gives them back.  No thread may still be
//! running translated code when that happens.  Each thread counts the
//! translated frames it is in and how many of them are parked in a syscall made
//! through the slow path, ocerz_jit_exec_one; any other slow-path call returns
//! soon enough to leave by a stop site, and parking every call cost R.E.P.O.'s
//! worker threads a tenth to a quarter of their busy time in atomics and
//! thread-local lookups.  The flusher bumps a generation, patches every stop
//! site so a running thread leaves at its next block edge (one cache line
//! synchronised per patched word), and waits until every thread's two counts are
//! equal; a thread that reaches the dispatcher meanwhile runs its next
//! instruction in the interpreter rather than waiting, so a collector that has
//! frozen a thread can still get round to resuming it.  A parked call that
//! returns into a newer generation goes back to its run loop rather than into
//! the arena: the slow path has already written the guest state to the cpu, so
//! that is the exit the block itself would have taken, and the call's result is
//! handed over with it.  A thread that cannot leave within 500 ms (one stopped
//! by thread_suspend while it spins, say) makes the flush give up and restore
//! the stop-site words it changed, and the next attempt waits two seconds; a
//! thread that is itself inside translated code never flushes.
//! OCERZ_NO_JIT_FLUSH=1 keeps the old behaviour.
//!
//! Retiring one block clears the return-address cells that predict a return
//! into it.  Walking every registered cell for that held the JIT lock for time
//! proportional to all the code translated since the last flush, so each cell
//! is also filed under the 512-byte granule of the entry it was given (at
//! emission, at a tcache bind, or when a pending return target arrives), and a
//! retire visits only the granules its code covers, re-checking each cell's
//! current value and dropping entries that have since moved on.  Cells are code
//! words, so the only writers are those three and the clears; slots are data and
//! are still walked.  The index is emptied with the cells: at a flush, when all
//! code is invalidated, and abandoned unfreed in a fork child.
//!
//! ---- faults and fork ----
//! A fault inside a block reconstructs the guest state from the host registers:
//! a push whose store faulted has already decremented rsp in its host register
//! (+8 repairs it), elided return-address slots are written back so the
//! interpreter can resume mid-frame, and the XMM pins are recovered from the
//! signal frame's NEON state because the memory copy is stale.  A fork child
//! inherits the parent's MAP_JIT arena, whose pages fault when executed, so the
//! child abandons the arena (rather than freeing it - the fork may have caught
//! the allocator mid-update) and builds a fresh one on its next step.
//!
//!
//! b, and bl: a chained direct call is a bl into its callee
//!
//! An entry's rip word carries its column's retire generation above the address
//!     (rip ^ gen), so retiring a block bumps its column's vm->psc_gen instead of
//!     searching every table: a canonical target only matches an entry filled in
//!     its column's current generation.  (A non-canonical one, which would fault on
//!     x86, could meet an older generation's entry.)
//!
//! A PSC entry for a block sits in the column its own rip selects, bits 2-6,
//!     because the indirect tail stores the rip it looked up beside that block's
//!     body.  Retiring bumps those columns' generations after the blocks have left
//!     the hash table, so a miss that refills from the table never tags a retired
//!     body with a current generation.  A generation that wraps clears its column.
